About Me
========

My name is Matt Alcock and I'm a Data Scientist, Analytics Lead and Python fan.  I'm currently the Lead Analyst at NaturalMotion Games where I manage a small team of data analysts. I currently work and live in Oxford. I've worked in small startups and large multinational companies covering a variety of industries including games, finance and fashion. I've been working with data for 10+ years and although my jobs have been varried they've all centered around drawing insight from large data sets. 

I split the majority of my time between Oxford and London. If you'd like to meet for a coffee or discuss anything please  drop me a message through one of the following channels:

The website is a collection of observations, thoughts, notes and side projects. A lot of the supporting code for the blog posts can be found in a public repo under my `github account <http://github.com/mattalcock>`_.

The website itself is written in restructured text and built with a small

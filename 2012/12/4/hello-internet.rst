  The obligatory first post.

Hello Internet
==============

The oblatory first post. I'll be honest I've been meaning to start and commit to a blog for sometime. After some false starts covering my broad spectrum of interests I've decided to focus on writing about my thoughts as a Data Scientist. I'm hoping people will find this informative and insightful. If there are any thoughts, feedback or collaborations that come from this then the blog will have been a success. So please let me know what you think.

I've been working with data for 10 years and my job title has jumped around from Developer, Data Analyst, Quantitate Analyst, Team Leader, Product Manager, Warehouse Manager, Head Of Analytics, Lead Analyst and Data Scientist. So what am I? I'm not sure everyone fits into role buckets but one thing I am convinced of is that everyones interests and expertise is different. I enjoy managing small technical teams, I love working with large amounts of data and I have the expertise to apply statistical and scientific methods to my work. 

Below are some biases and opinions I should mention before I start. I'll explain these in more detail over the coming posts but their four personal and somewhat subjective opinions I wanted to share from the outset.
`
-    I'm love the power of modern NoSQL data stores but still feel SQL is an amazing tool for analysis thats hard to beat.
-    I think data can unlock questions and give insights into almost every area of business but also I understand it's not the silver bullet. It should be used with creativity, lateral thinking and domain expertise not instead of it.
-    I love the concise power of statistics but realise they're frequently misleading and often poorly presented and explained.
-    I'm program language agnostic but love to use Python

The blog will contain, thoughts, tools, projects and some book reviews. If there is anything you'd like me to talk about or review please drop me an mail.

I hope you like whats to come.........
